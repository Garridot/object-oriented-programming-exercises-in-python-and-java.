# Warehouse System: Cash Register
## Overview
For this project, you will need to develop a cash register system for a warehouse. 

#### To-do list:  
* The system should allow the cashier to scan a product by typing in the product ID, adding it to the customer's list of purchased items, and displaying the subtotal. 
* It must also enable the cashier to update the quantity of a product or remove a product from the list as needed.

* The cashier can finalize the purchase at any time, and the system should automatically apply the applicable discount for the customer. 
* Once the cashier enters the amount the customer pays, the system will calculate and display the change that needs to be returned.

The project's objective is to correctly apply the principles of OOP, focusing on encapsulation and abstraction. Additionally, it should adhere to good practices such as the single responsibility principle and the use of class methods. ðŸ˜Š
